    <h1>My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be?</h1>
    <h2>What is a website?</h2>
    <p>For the past handful of years, I’ve been teaching courses about interactive design and the internet.</p>
<p>
     I teach within art departments at universities, so we learn about the internet’s impact on art—and vice versa—and how technological advance often coincides with artistic development.
    In class, we make websites. To do this, we learn the elemental markup and code languages of the web—HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript.
</p>
<p>However, sometimes after the semester is over, I receive perplexing emails from students asking, “So how do I actually make a website?”</p>
